                        <br>Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m</li>

                        <br>Git’s <em>--amend</em> flag is extremely useful when updating a commit, it allows you to correct mistakes and edit commits easily instead of creating a completely new one (by deleting the original and placing this commit in its place). Remember to make the changes, use <em>git add</em> to stage the changes, and finally use <em>git commit --amend</em>. The git terminal will ask you to update your commit message. However, if you want to keep the same commit message, you can simply add the flag <em>--no-edit</em>.

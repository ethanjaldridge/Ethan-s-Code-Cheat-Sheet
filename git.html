                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ul>

                        <br>Git’s <em>--amend</em> flag is extremely useful when updating a commit, it allows you to correct mistakes and edit commits easily instead of creating a completely new one (by deleting the original and placing this commit in its place). Remember to make the changes, use <em>git add</em> to stage the changes, and finally use <em>git commit --amend</em>. The git terminal will ask you to update your commit message. However, if you want to keep the same commit message, you can simply add the flag <em>--no-edit</em>.

                    <td>GitHub is both a website and a service that facilitates software development by allowing you to store your code in containers, called repositories, and by tracking changes made to your code. In addition, it offers a hosting service and tools to build, test, and deploy code. GitHub uses Git, a version-control development tool, to manage your projects by tracking changes to files and allowing multiple people to work on the same project. Although both GitHub and Git have similar names, GitHub is a service while Git is a development tool that can be used by you outside of and without GitHub.

                        <br>With Git, each teammate can create their own branch off of the main project in order to work on bug-fixes, new features, experimental code, etc. By using separate branches, the main project remains intact and unaffected before the changes are reviewed and merged into the project.
                        <br>
                        <br>Pull requests on GitHub allow collaborators to review and give feedback on proposed code changes before they are merged into the main branch. Through a process of discussion and potentially some extra code changes, the pull request can be ultimately approved, which means you can merge the changes into the official project on the main branch. When creating pull requests, it’s imperative that you include as much relevant detail in the description as possible in order to save review time. Add any comments or images that might be useful for your reviewer. Lastly, you don’t want to submit a pull request with 50 files containing a plethora of changes — instead, stick to smaller-sized pull requests since they’re easier and faster to review.
                        <br>
                        <br>The pull request should include a description and GitHub will display all the files with the changes created. Each line of code will have a clickable “+” button where you can add a comment in regards to the line. Here are few best practices when reviewing code: 
                        <br>

When it asks you to select where to merge from, select the branch with the desired changes.</li>

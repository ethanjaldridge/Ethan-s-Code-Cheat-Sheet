For example, if the base font of a browser is 16 pixels (which is normally the default size of text in a browser), then 1 em is equal to 16 pixels. 2 ems would equal 32 pixels, and so on.</td>

The root element is the &lt;html&gt; tag. Most browsers set the font size of &lt;html&gt; to 16 pixels, so by default <em>rem</em> measurements will be compared to that value. To set a different font size for the root element, you can add a CSS rule. One advantage of using <em>rem</em> is that all elements are compared to the same font size value, making it easy to predict how large or small font will appear. If you are interested in sizing elements consistently across an entire website, the <em>rem</em> measurement is the best unit for the job. If you’re interested in sizing elements in comparison to other elements nearby, then the <em>em</em> unit would be better suited for the job.</td>

When height and width are set using percentages, the dimensions of child elements are calculated based on the dimensions of the parent element. When percentages are used to set padding and margin, however, they are calculated based only on the width of the parent element. They can also be used to set positioning properties (top, bottom, left, right). Be careful, a child element’s dimensions (.subsection) may be set erroneously if the dimensions of its parent element (.main) aren’t set first. Because the box model includes padding, borders, and margins, setting an element’s width to 100% may cause content to overflow its parent container. While tempting, 100% should only be used when content will not have padding, border, or margin.</td>

With media queries, CSS can detect the size of the current screen and apply different CSS styles depending on the width of the screen. In the example, the media query defines a rule for screens smaller than 480 pixels (approximately the width of many smartphones in landscape orientation). <em>@media</em> — This keyword begins a media query rule and instructs the CSS compiler on how to parse the rest of the rule. <em>only screen</em> — Indicates what types of devices should use this rule. In early attempts to target different devices, CSS incorporated different media types (screen, print, handheld). The rationale was that by knowing the media type, the proper CSS rules could be applied. However, “handheld” and “screen” devices began to occupy a much wider range of sizes and having only one CSS rule per media device was not sufficient. <em>screen</em> is the media type always used for displaying content, no matter the type of device. The <em>only</em> keyword is added to indicate that this rule only applies to one media type (<em>screen</em>). <em>and (max-width : 480px)</em> — This part of the rule is called a media feature, and instructs the CSS compiler to apply the CSS styles to devices with a width of 480 pixels or smaller. Media features are the conditions that must be met in order to render the CSS within a media query. CSS rules are nested inside of the media query’s curly braces {}. The rules will be applied when the media query is met. In the example above, the text in the body element is set to a font-size of 12px when the user’s screen is less than 480px.</td>

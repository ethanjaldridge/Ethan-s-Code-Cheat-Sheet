                    <td>Validation is the concept of checking user provided data against the required data. Most data, once submitted, is stored by a website or web application (data submitted through forms are stored as strings). It’s stored in a database on the server side. There are important reasons for us to make sure the information that will be stored in the database is accurate (to prevent username doubling, address error in shipping, leaking of personal info, etc.)</td>

                    <td>To specify patterns for the computer to recognize, we use a special language called <em>regular expressions</em> — also known as <em>regex</em> or <em>regexp</em>. A regular expression is a sequence of characters representing a pattern. We can use that pattern to match a string, match parts of a string, confirm that data is formatted acceptably, or even replace parts of strings with different characters. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/regexp?page_ref=catalog" target="_blank">More on regex</a></td>

                    <td><em>Client-side validation</em> occurs when problematic inputs are prevented from being submitted in the first place. The client is the process interacting with the server on behalf of a user—in the case of websites, the web browser is the client. The logic for validating the form is included with the code that displays the form on the user’s device. No interaction with the back-end is required to perform client-side validations. HTML provides some of these validation features built-in (required fields, min and max values, input must match a particular pattern specified by a regular expression).</td>

                    <td>In order to truly customize validation or to perform more complex validations, we can incorporate JavaScript form validations. We can do this by either writing the JavaScript ourselves or by incorporating a JavaScript library. Most basic validation libraries will involve directly accessing or manipulating the DOM. This can get tricky when working with a framework that relies on a virtual DOM, like React or Vue. In those situations, it might be best to incorporate a library that works well with your specific framework.</td>

                    <td>Validations must also be completed on the back-end or server-side. As a rule, the back-end should never trust the data it receives. Front-end validations are easy to bypass. A malicious user can simply turn off JavaScript on their browser, for example. There’s also the potential for middleman attacks in which data is changed after the request is submitted by a user but before it arrives at the server.
                        <br>
                        <br>Advantages of server-side validation:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Once data is in the back-end, the developer has complete control over it.</li>
                                <li>Developers can use validation code, often on machines with more computing power.</li>
                                <li>Developers can write validation code that a user can’t see (more difficult for malicious users to hack).</li>
                                <li>Developers can validate the information against other data the front-end doesn’t have access to (is the username taken?).</li>
                            </ul>
                        <br>
                        <br>There are two main ways to validate inputs on the server-side. The first takes place while the user is still inputting data into the form on the front-end. We can make asynchronous requests to the server with pieces of their data and send feedback directly to the user before they’ve submitted. This is slower than front-end validation and can be a design challenge from a user-experience perspective.
                        <br>
                        <br>The second is once the form has been submitted. Back-end form validation is our application’s last defense against problematic data, and it’s essential to verify the validity and safety of data before adding it to a database. This is also an opportunity to “sanitize” the data: in order for our database to be useful, it’s important that all data within it is formatted consistently. This means that while we may want to be flexible about the formatting we require from a user, we likely want to transform inputs into a strict format before entering them in the database.

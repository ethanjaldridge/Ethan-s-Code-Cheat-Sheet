To fully distinguish the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript: if you want to create an app or program you can use JavaScript — if you want to create a new scripting language you can follow the guidelines in ECMAScript. So, when you see ES6 or JavaScript ES6, it means that that version of JavaScript is following the specifications in the sixth edition of ECMAScript!</td>
